Updated Technical Requirements
Your app must:

Use Express as a foundation.
Use Mongoose for models and database communication.
Have 2 models or more. Having one for users is a no-brainer. The other one(s) should represent the main functionality of your app. Don’t force it if having more than two models doesn’t make sense.
Have validation on its models with feedback for users if their submission is invalid.
Include sign up, log in & log out functionality with encrypted passwords (and/or social logins) and authorization (logged in users can do extra things).
Have routes for all of CRUD for models other than users. There should have created, read, update, and delete features even if they aren’t all for the same model.
Have a repo on GitHub.
Have at least 1 commit per day that you worked on it.
Be deployed online using Heroku so that anybody could use your app.
Responsive design is not a requirement, but it’s nice to have.

Updated Deliverables
A working full-stack application, built by you that runs on a server.
A deploy of your app on Heroku.
The URL of the GitHub repository for your app.
The URL of the live app on the Internet.
The URL of the slides for your app’s presentation.
You must present your app during Project #2 final presentations (last day of Project #2 time).
Presentations
Project #2 presentation will focus mostly on your project. You won’t have to talk much about yourselves or your background. You should still introduce yourselves briefly.

Format
Talking with Slides: 3 minutes
Demo: 2 minutes
Total: 5 minutes
Attire
Dress nicely for this and all final project presentations (last day of each project’s time).
Dress at least one degree more elegantly than you usually dress for class.
Examples:
If you wear t-shirts every day, wear a button-down shirt.
If you wear jeans every day, wear some slacks.
If you wear sneakers every day, wear nicer shoes.
Slide Applications
All presentations will be done from a staff member’s computer, so your slides need to be online.
PowerPoint files, Keynote files or files of any kind will not be accepted.
Suggested online slide applications:
Slides
Prezi
Google Slides
Presentation Structure
Title Slide (1 slide): your project’s name & your name
Project Elevator Pitch (1-2 slides):
What is your project?
How does it work?
Why did you choose it?
Technical Challenge (1-2 slides):
What was the most important technical challenge you faced?
How did you overcome that challenge?
Big Mistake (1-2 slides):
What was the biggest mistake you made during this project?
What did you learn from it?
Demo Slide (1 slide): literally says “DEMO” with a link to your project so you can open it easily
Closing Slide (1 slide): your project’s name, your name & a “Thank You”
Total: 6-9 slides
Presentation Structure Notes
Don’t include a slide just for the technologies.
Don’t include any code in your slides. Nobody will read it.
Don’t include a slide for GitHub graphs.
Don’t go into detail about how the app works. Your demo is where you want to do that.
If you think that deviating from the structure improves your presentation, feel free to do so. This suggested structure is mostly for people who don’t know what to do.
Demo Tips
Plan what you are going to demo and practice it on the live site. That way you won’t be surprised if something breaks on the live version.
Deploy early so you can squash bugs. There are always bugs on the live site at first.
Add link to your live project to your DEMO slide so you can start it smoothly.
Your app’s colors and sizing might look different on the projector. If you think it might be a problem, ask to test it beforehand.
If your app is on Heroku, refresh it before you present. Otherwise, there will be a delay on the initial load.
Project Feedback and Evaluation
Technical Requirements: Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements?

Creativity: Did you add a personal spin or creative element into your project?

Code Quality: Did you follow code style guidance and best practices?

Deployment: Did you deploy your application to a public url using Heroku/some other platform?

Total: Your instructors will give you a total score on your project between:

Score	Expectations
0	Didn’t meet expectations
1	Met expectations, good job!
2	Exceeded expectations, you magnificent creature, you!
You should use the feedback to focus on what needs to be improved for the next project.

Good luck! :heart:
